Multi-Agent AI Conversation App - Build Specification

Overview

This application allows users to configure and host multi-agent AI conversations where synthetic personas negotiate a mutually acceptable outcome. Users can define each AI participant's background and goals, then let them converse in sequence while maintaining context. The system supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, etc.).

Core Features

2. Synthetic Persona Configuration

Each AI persona has:

Name

Background Information (context about their role, history, biases)

Desired Outcome (goal they seek in negotiation)

Assigned AI Model (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude)

Input fields for defining each persona.

3. Conversation Management
